# **Lab 05: Troubleshooting an EC2 LAMP Deployment with AWS CLI**

## üìò Overview

This deployment demonstrates how to automate a full LAMP environment using a user data script. It covers troubleshooting AMI mismatches, resolving connectivity issues, and verifying that both the web and database layers function correctly through the Caf√© web app.

---

## üéØ Goal

Deploy a complete **LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, PHP)** on an Amazon EC2 instance using the **AWS CLI**, and host the **Caf√© Web Application**.

---

## üß∞ Tools Used

- **AWS CLI**
- **Amazon EC2**
- **Apache (HTTPD)**
- **MariaDB**
- **PHP**
- **nmap** (for port scanning and verification)

---

## Architecture

A single EC2 instance running the full LAMP stack, publicly accessible via HTTP (port 80). The web server hosts the Caf√© web app and connects locally to the MariaDB database.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Performed

### Step 1: Environment Setup

- Connected to the **CLI Host** instance.
- Configured the **AWS CLI** using provided credentials.
- Executed the provided **shell script** to launch and configure the EC2 LAMP instance.

üìå | The instance initialization relied on user data to automate installation and configuration of Apache, PHP, and MariaDB.

### User Data Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum -y update
amazon-linux-extras install -y lamp-mariadb10.2-php7.2 php7.2
yum -y install httpd mariadb-server

systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd

systemctl enable mariadb
systemctl start mariadb

echo '<html><h1>Hello From Your Web Server!</h1></html>' > /var/www/html/index.html
find /var/www -type d -exec chmod 2775 {} \;
find /var/www -type f -exec chmod 0664 {} \;
echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > /var/www/html/phpinfo.php

usermod -a -G apache ec2-user
chown -R ec2-user:apache /var/www
chmod 2775 /var/www

cd db
./set-root-password.sh
./create-db.sh
hostnamectl set-hostname web-server

```

üìå | Errors and progress can be reviewed in `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`.

### Step 2: Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

### Issue 1: Invalid AMI ID

**Error:**

```bash
InvalidAMIID.NotFound

```

![Launching an EC2 from an AMI with an Error](screenshots/IvalidAMIID.png)

**Root Cause:**

The AMI ID referenced in the script did not exist in the current AWS region. It was hardcoded for `us-east-2`, but deployment occurred in `us-west-2`.

**Resolution:**

Replaced the hardcoded AMI ID with a dynamic `$region` variable to ensure compatibility across regions.

üìå | Note: Always verify that the AMI ID used in scripts exists in the active region before deployment.

---

### Issue 2: Web Application Inaccessible

**Symptom:** The public IP returned no response after instance launch.

**Troubleshooting Process:**

- Ran a port scan using `nmap` on the instance public IP.
    
    ```bash
    nmap <public-ip>
    ```
    
    ![Nmap Result](screenshots/Nmap.png)
    
    Result: Port 80 was **closed**.
    
- Checked **Security Group inbound rules**. Port 80 was missing.
- Added an inbound rule for **HTTP (port 80)**.

After updating the security group, the web page loaded successfully.

üìå | Note: Security group misconfigurations are a common cause of connectivity failures. Always verify inbound and outbound rules early.

---

### Step 3: Verifying Setup

To confirm that user data executed properly:

```bash
sudo cat -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log

```

Apache, MariaDB, and PHP installations completed without error. The Caf√© web app and database scripts were successfully initialized.

Testing the web interface confirmed that dessert orders were recorded and reflected correctly in the **Order History**, verifying database connectivity.

üìå | Note: Cloud-init logs are the most reliable way to confirm user data execution on EC2.

## üìù Key Takeaways

- **AMI IDs are region-specific** ‚Äî use variables or parameterized inputs for portability.
- **Security Groups** must include correct inbound rules (especially for HTTP/HTTPS).
- **`nmap`** is a practical tool for verifying network accessibility.
- **Cloud-init logs** provide essential feedback on automated setup scripts.
